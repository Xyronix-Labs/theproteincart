It consistently delivers on its promises, making it an everyday essential for serious athletes and bodybuilders.\n\nThis powerhouse supplement actively increases lean muscle mass and improves strength and power. It can also inhibit myostatin, a protein that limits muscle growth, further boosting your potential. By replenishing ATP, creatine ensures better performance and reduces fatigue, allowing you to push harder and achieve superior results in every session.",

        "Description":"Build rock hard muscle, increase strength & lose fat at the same time!\nAfter one university study and several blood trials, as well as ample empirical data, it' a fact : Myodrol-HSP is the world' most powerful muscle builder by some distance! You absolutely can increase the rates at which you build muscle and lose fat! But we didn't stop there. We took the next anabolic\/lipolytic step.\nWe've invented a brand new compound that literally makes all other muscle hardening compounds completely obsolete! In fact, even though our new formula is still called Myodrol-HSP, the design has changed so dramatically that there' no aromatizing compounds left in the molecule!\nIs Myodrol-HSP like HMB or Deca, or Somewhere In Between?\nAll in all, the old version of Myodrol-HSP showed a great deal of promise. But did it pan out in the real world, in the gym and on the scales?\nWell, the answer is a conditional yes!\nThe reason I said results are conditional, is because there are four key factors that must be successfully dealt with before you see muscle gains and fat loss. It' just like taking steroids. If you don't achieve and sustain high enough blood levels, you can kiss results goodbye, bubba.\nWe brought Myodrol-HSP to the supplement industry, which has resulted in many new products hitting the market that contain the anabolic flavone. Unfortunately, most of the companies that developed these supplements didn't pay attention to the doses required for muscle-building results or the delivery system required to efficiently load the body. As a result, most of the methoxy products don't work!\nOn the other hand, we funded research to find out the facts. We knew we needed better answers. We wanted to determine the effective dose for achieving maximum results. We also wanted to evaluate just how effective our delivery system is.\nBottom line, after one university study and several blood trials, as well as ample empirical data, we've now determined that compounds in Myodrol-HSP does indeed work! You absolutely can increase the rates at which you build muscle and lose fat! But, you have two high hurdles to overcome before getting the gold. In other words, if you don't incorporate the proper dosing and delivery parameters with methoxy, it'll be as effective as HMB it won't work!\nThe first obstacle we tackled was the delivery system. We found that our engineered caplet system is approximately 10 times more efficient than regular, encapsulated active ingredients at achieving optimal blood concentrations. So, you'd have to take grams of the regular stuff to get the same amount in the body as you'd achieve with 2500 mg of our Myodrol-HSP engineered plant extracts. Based on our calculations, our system transports nearly 100% of the active ingredients into the body.\nSo, as you can see, it' no surprise that most of the other products on the market don't work. You'd have to take 15 grams of the stuff a day! And at those amounts, you're bound to have an absorption problem. Our only conclusion is that it' impossible to achieve optimal results without a delivery system as effective as our liquid.\nYou can say that I'm biased, that I have an economic interest in essentially saying our liquid is the only one that works. I'm also dead-on right. Just because I have an economic interest in something doesn't preclude me from stating the facts. And it' a fact : Our liquid is the only effective delivery system for methoxy that' currently on the market.\nDoes that mean that there never will be another method of delivery as good or even better? Absolutely not! In fact, it' hard for me to intellectually fathom the idea that other methods couldn't be developed. It' just that, other than Myogenetix, no one has produced one to date.\nThe second very important discovery we made has to do with dosing. We began our research using a daily dose of 1000 mg (500 mg 2x\/day). Later on, however, we determined that 1000 mg was too low, and that 2500 mg is the ideal dosage for all the subjects we evaluated. Statistically, we did see anabolic\/lipolytic trends at 1000 mg, but 2500 is where you really notice the effects.\nBut even at the 1000-mg level, in eight weeks, subjects gained 5 pounds of LBM and lost 4 pounds of body fat without reducing calories. And when you increase the dosage to 2500 mg a day, results seem to more than double, which is spectacular considering we're not affecting androgen levels.\nIs Myodrol-HSP like HMB or Deca, or Somewhere In Between?\nAll in all, the old version of Myodrol-HSP showed a great deal of promise. But did it pan out in the real world, in the gym and on the scales?\nWell, the answer is a conditional yes!\nThe reason I said results are conditional, is because there are four key factors that must be successfully dealt with before you see muscle gains and fat loss.

You absolutely can increase the rates at which you build muscle and lose fat! But, you have two high hurdles to overcome before getting the gold. In other words, if you don't incorporate the proper dosing and delivery parameters with methoxy, it'll be as effective as HMB it won't work!\nThe first obstacle we tackled was the delivery system. We found that our engineered caplet system is approximately 10 times more efficient than regular, encapsulated active ingredients at achieving optimal blood concentrations. So, you'd have to take grams of the regular stuff to get the same amount in the body as you'd achieve with 2500 mg of our Myodrol-HSP engineered plant extracts. Based on our calculations, our system transports nearly 100% of the active ingredients into the body.\nSo, as you can see, it's no surprise that most of the other products on the market don't work. You'd have to take 15 grams of the stuff a day! And at those amounts, you're bound to have an absorption problem. Our only conclusion is that it's impossible to achieve optimal results without a delivery system as effective as our liquid.\nYou can say that I'm biased, that I have an economic interest in essentially saying our liquid is the only one that works. I'm also dead-on right. Just because I have an economic interest in something doesn't preclude me from stating the facts. And it's a fact : Our liquid is the only effective delivery system for methoxy that's currently on the market.\nDoes that mean that there never will be another method of delivery as good or even better? Absolutely not! In fact, it's hard for me to intellectually fathom the idea that other methods couldn't be developed. It's just that, other than Myogenetix, no one has produced one to date.\nThe second very important discovery we made has to do with dosing. We began our research using a daily dose of 1000 mg (500 mg 2x\/day). Later on, however, we determined that 1000 mg was too low, and that 2500 mg is the ideal dosage for all the subjects we evaluated. Statistically, we did see anabolic\/lipolytic trends at 1000 mg, but 2500 is where you really notice the effects.\nBut even at the 1000-mg level, in eight weeks, subjects gained 5 pounds of LBM and lost 4 pounds of body fat without reducing calories. And when you increase the dosage to 2500 mg a day, results seem to more than double, which is spectacular considering we're not affecting androgen levels.\n",

        "Description":"YODROL Platinum | MUSCLE BUILDING FORMULA\nBuild rock hard muscle, increase strength & lose fat at the same time!\nAfter one university study and several blood trials, as well as ample empirical data, it\u2019s a fact : Myodrol-HSP\u00ae is the world\u2019s most powerful muscle builder by some distance! You absolutely can increase the rates at which you build muscle and lose fat! But we didn\u2019t stop there. We took the next anabolic\/lipolytic step.\nWe\u2019ve invented a brand new compound that literally makes all other muscle hardening compounds completely obsolete! In fact, even though our new formula is still called Myodrol-HSP\u00ae, the design has changed so dramatically that there\u2019s no aromatizing compounds left in the molecule!\nIs Myodrol-HSP\u00ae like HMB or Deca, or Somewhere In Between?\nAll in all, the old version of Myodrol-HSP\u00ae showed a great deal of promise. But did it pan out in the real world, in the gym and on the scales?\nWell, the answer is a conditional yes!\n. The reason I said results are \u201cconditional,\u201d is because there are four key factors that must be successfully dealt with before you see muscle gains and fat loss. It\u2019s just like taking steroids. If you don\u2019t achieve and sustain high enough blood levels, you can kiss results goodbye, bubba.\n. We brought Myodrol-HSP\u00ae to the supplement industry, which has resulted in many new products hitting the market that contain the anabolic flavone. Unfortunately, most of the companies that developed these supplements didn\u2019t pay attention to the doses required for muscle-building results or the delivery system required to efficiently load the body. As a result, most of the methoxy products don\u2019t work!\n. On the other hand, we funded research to find out the facts. We knew we needed better answers. We wanted to determine the effective dose for achieving maximum results. We also wanted to evaluate just how effective our delivery system is.\n. Bottom line, after one university study and several blood trials, as well as ample empirical data, we\u2019ve now determined that compounds in Myodrol-HSP\u00ae does indeed work!

Myodrol-HSP\u00ae takes is foundations from Hungarian discovery of 5-methyl-7-methoxy-isoflavone, a metabolic agent which can offer anabolic activities with no androgenic side effects as it comes under the category of non-hormonal anabolic \/ anti-catabolic compounds. These powerful flavones have been shown to decrease cortisol levels, increase protein synthesis, and improve overall recovery from exercise.\n. Methoxy isoflavone was developed by Hungarian researchers as a way to increase lean body mass in live stock without increasing the amount of their food intake. The researchers findings indicate that Methoxy isoflavone increases nutrient usage and also suppresses cortisol, a stress hormone that causes muscle wasting.\n. These plant isoflavones increase protein synthesis and lean mass. They also reduce body fat, lower cholesterol levels, promote endurance, an increase state of vitality, and increase the body\u2019s ability to use oxygen All this with out negative side effects.\nIs Myodrol-HSP\u00ae like HMB or Deca, or Somewhere In Between?\nAll in all, the old version of Myodrol-HSP\u00ae showed a great deal of promise.

Experience all the benefits of quality fish oil support for heart, brain, and joint health without the fishy aftertaste.\r\n\r\nComprehensive Health Benefits :\r\nHeart Health: Omega-3 fatty acids support normal cardiovascular function. They do this by supporting a healthy inflammation response and helping maintain healthy blood lipid levels within the normal range.\r\n\r\nBrain Power: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is a major structural component of the brain. Getting enough DHA in your diet can support cognitive function, neuronal development, and overall brain health.\r\n\r\nJoint Comfort: These essential fatty acids help support healthy inflammatory responses, which can help keep your joints feeling great so you can stay active and crush your workouts.\r\n\r\nSuperior Absorption & Purity :\r\nWe use a triglyceride form of omega-3s that digests easily and is highly-absorbable. This form is what\u2019s found naturally in fresh fish and has shown a 90% absorption rate, in contrast to the typical 60% rate for supermarket fish oils. Kaged Omega-3 is Friend of the Sea certified, meaning our fish are caught with a priority on sustainability and minimal environmental impact.

        "Description":"INCREASES MUSCLE MASS : It is widely asserted that abundant availability of essential amino acids is a requisite for a significant stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. The balance between muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown will determine changes in muscle size. Your resistance training stimulates signaling pathways inside muscle cells and increases muscle protein synthesis. BCAAs, when taken in conjunction with resistance training, provide key building blocks for muscle protein synthesis, help maintain net muscle protein balance, and increase muscle mass. Glutamine prevents lactate production and protects muscles from entering a catabolic state.\r\nENHANCES RECOVERY FROM MUSCLE DAMAGE : Eccentric exercise may result in damage to muscle, increase muscle soreness, and decrease muscle function. BCAAs help alleviate this response to intense training. Athletes supplementing with BCAA experience minimal muscle soreness in their regular training. BCAA supplements may be potentially beneficial in reducing muscle soreness when starting a new training program or returning from a period of rest or injury. BCAAs stimulate muscle protein synthesis, helping reduce markers of exercise-induced muscle damage. The added potassium facilitates stronger muscle contraction, and vitamin B6 provides an energy boost.\r\nCAN LIMIT FATIGUE : BCAAs can fight the rate at which you tire from exercise. Prolonged workouts can elevate tryptophan levels in the blood, which may increase serotonin a factor in central fatigue. BCAA supplementation during exercise inhibits tryptophan transport to the brain, lowers serotonin synthesis, and delays fatigue during intense workouts. L-Citrulline boosts arginine levels, promoting nitric oxide production, enhancing circulation, improving nutrient delivery, and aiding in ATP production to reduce fatigue.\r\nBenefits of ATOM BCAA :\r\n. Golden ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 leucine, isoleucine & valine\r\n. Stimulates muscle protein synthesis | Reduces muscle catabolism\r\n. Promotes muscle pumps | Reduces muscle fatigue\r\n. Preserves muscle mass | Supports muscle recovery\r\n. Prevents muscle loss | Enhances strength gains\r\n. L-Glutamine delays fatigue | L-Carnitine promotes fat loss\r\n.
